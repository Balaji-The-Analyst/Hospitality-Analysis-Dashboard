### PROJECT DETAILS 
**1.Domain :--> Hospitality**

The hospitality domain encompasses industries and services that focus on providing comfortable, welcoming experiences for customers. This domain includes hotels, resorts, restaurants, tourism, event planning, and travel-related services. Hospitality businesses prioritize customer satisfaction, aiming to enhance guest experiences through quality service, convenience, and personal touches.

This project focuses on multiple five-star hotels offering luxury accommodations, high-end amenities, gourmet dining, and personalized experiences, ensuring guests enjoy unparalleled comfort and sophistication.

**2.Problem**
A company in the hospitality industry is losing market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel sectors. Competitor strategies and ineffective management decisions have led to a decline in performance. Without an in-house data analytics team, they lack insights from historical data, hindering their ability to make data-driven decisions to improve operations.
